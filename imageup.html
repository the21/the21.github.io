<p>
Image Up is a Google Docs add-on, which allows you to put an image above the text. This kind of placement, unfortunately, is not supported by Google Docs by defeault without any add-ons. Can be extremely useful in case you need to add your signature or protect the document with a watermark before exporting to PDF or printing.
