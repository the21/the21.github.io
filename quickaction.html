Long story short. Quick Action is an addon for Gmail to make us free from repeatable and routine actions.</p>

<p>After working in IT companies for years I figured out that I've sent a lot of 'ok', 'It works for me' and other emails. Also I've forwarded all press and media inquiries to our PR guys zillions of times. Same story with your email?</p>

<p>The only way to do it is to press Reply button, then paste text (from templates of not), fill To Cc Bcc fields and pres the Send button. One day I've asked myself - why am I spent my time and energy on it for years? We've sent a man to the Moon and we still can't automize those simple routines?</p>

<p>So I developed Quick Action and then my friends and colleagues started asking me to share it with you. When I've got too many requests I decided to publish it as an addon available for everyone. So we're here and I hope Quick Action will help you spent your time and energy on things, which are really matter to you :) Have a good one!</p>
